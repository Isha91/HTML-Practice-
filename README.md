    <h1> INTRODUCTION </h1> <br>  

    <p> Computer Science Fundamentals is a 6-credit hour course offered by the department.
        This is a project-intensive course that covers computer programming and fundamental
        computer science.
        If you do not have an undergraduate degree in computer science, you must complete
        this course. Computer Science Fundamentals starts you on your journey towards your
        formal master’s program. You can waive it if you pass a proficiency exam offered the
        week before classes start. Students will have the choice of using either C, C++, or Java
        to solve the proficiency exam questions.
        Students who are successful in this course go on to succeed in their master’s degree
        program. They have cutting edge knowledge in computer science coupled with excellent
        programming skills. This provides them with excellent job opportunities in the future

<h2>  Data Structure and Algorithms: </h2>

<p> 
    A computer program is a collection of instructions to perform a specific task. For this, a
    computer program may need to store data, retrieve data, and perform computations on
    the data
    A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And,
    an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning data
    structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.
    Our DSA tutorial will guide you to learn different types of data structures and algorithms
    and their implementations in Python, C, C++, and Java

<h2> Data Analyst: </h2>

<p> Data Analytics refers to the techniques used to analyze data to enhance
productivity and business gain.
2. Data is extracted from various sources and is cleaned and categorized to analyze
various behavioral patterns.
3. The techniques and the tools used vary according to the organization or
individual
